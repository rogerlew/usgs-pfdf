## Summary

The pfdf (postfire debris-flow) package provides utilities intended to facilitate postfire debris-flow hazard assessments and research. The package contains routines to:

* Download assessment datasets
* Analyze watersheds
* Delineate and filter stream segment networks
* Compute earth-system variables for stream segments in a network
* Assess debris-flow probabilities using the models of Staley and others, 2017
* Assess potential sediment volumes using the models of Gartner and others, 2014
* Classify relative hazards using the methods of Cannon and others, 2010, and
* Export results to common GIS formats (such as Shapefiles and GeoJSON)
